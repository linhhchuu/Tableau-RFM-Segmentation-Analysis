## Project Summary
In this project, I performed an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation analysis to categorize customers based on their purchasing behaviors. RFM segmentation is a powerful marketing technique that helps businesses understand their customers' value and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. Using Tableau, I visualized the RFM segments to gain insights into customer segments and identify opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Objectives
- Segment Customers: Classify customers into different segments based on their recency, frequency, and monetary values.
- Visualize RFM Segments: Create interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize the RFM segments and provide actionable insights.
- Identify Key Customer Segments: Highlight high-value customers and potential churners to inform marketing strategies.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Collected transaction data from an e-commerce platform, including customer IDs, transaction dates, and transaction amounts.
2. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
3. **Calculated the RFM values for each customer:**
    - Recency: Days since the last purchase.
    - Frequency: Number of purchases within a specific period.
    - Monetary: Total amount spent by the customer.
4. **RFM Scoring:** Assigned scores to each RFM dimension on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest. Combined the scores to create an overall RFM score for each customer.
5. **Segmentation:**
    - Grouped customers into segments based on their RFM scores. Typical segments include:
        - Champions: Recent, frequent, and high spenders.
        - Loyal Customers: Frequent buyers with moderate to high spending.
        - Potential Loyalists: Recent buyers with potential to become loyal.
        - At Risk: Customers who haven't purchased in a while.
        - Churned: Customers who haven't purchased for a long time.
6. **Visualization:**
    - Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize the RFM segments.

## Potential Application
- Personalized Marketing: Tailoring marketing campaigns to specific customer segments based on their behavior.
- Customer Retention: Identifying at-risk customers and implementing strategies to retain them.
- Loyalty Programs: Designing and improving loyalty programs based on customer behavior patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Included filters, heat maps, and bar charts to explore the segments and their characteristics.
